# Multi Expression Programming - source code

## Contents

There are multiple source codes in this repository:

[mep_symbolic_regression](01.%20Symbolic%20regression/) - basic MEP algorithm. Solves symbolic regression and binary classification problems. This should be the starting point for everyone.

[mep_binary_classification](02.%20Binary%20classification/) - basic MEP algorithm. Solves symbolic regression and binary classification problems. This should be the starting point for everyone.

[mep_multiple_pop](03.%20Multiple%20populations%20-%20symbolic%20regression%20and%20binary%20classification/) - MEP with multiple (sub)populations for regression and binary classification problems.

[mep_multi_class](04.%20Multi-class%20classification/) - MEP algorithm. Solves regression and multi-class classification problems.

[mep_threads](05.%20Threads%20-%20Regression%20and%20classification/) - MEP with multiple (sub)populations evolved in different threads for regression and binary classification problems.

[mep_circuits](06.%20Digital%20circuits%20(multipliers)/) - MEP for evolving digital circuits.

[mep_parity_adfs](07.%20Even%20parity%20(with%20ADFs)/) - MEP algorithm with Automatically Defined Functions for Even-Parity problems.

[mep_evolve_EAs](08.%20Evolve%20Evolutionary%20Algorithms/) - MEP for evolving Evolutionary Algorithms.
## How to run

Take a _.cpp_ program from a folder and compile it.
You also need a dataset from the the same folder as the _cpp_ file. Make sure that you specify the path correctly.

## Datasets

There are multiple datasets in this repository:

**building1.txt** - a symbolic regression problem taken from PROBEN1.

**cancer1.txt** - a binary classification problem taken from PROBEN1.

**iris.txt** - a classification problem with 3 classes.

**gene1.dt** - a classification problem with 3 classes. Format of output is 1-of-m.

**2x2_multiplier.txt**, **3x3_multiplier.txt** - this is a problem of designing digital circuits (for 2x2 and 3x3 multiplication).

**even_6_parity.txt** - even parity problems with 7 inputs.
